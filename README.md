##  Ongoing Projects

### [Examia (AI-Powered Study Assistant)](https://github.com/VardhanVelamakanni/examia_llm_ollama)
- **Technologies:** LLM, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), LangChain, Python, Vector Databases
- **Description:** An intelligent academic tool designed for students. Users can upload PDFs or PPTs, and the system utilizes RAG to retrieve context and generate:
    * **Automated Question Framing:** Targeted questions derived directly from the source material.
    * **Contextual Answers:** Precise responses based on document content.
    * **Topic Summarization:** Simplified, topic-wise explanations to aid quick revision.

### [Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System](https://github.com/VardhanVelamakanni/P2P_file_sharing_system)
- **Technologies:** WebRTC, Node.js, Socket.io, React.js
- **Description:** A serverless-style file transfer application that eliminates the need for cloud storage. It establishes a direct **WebRTC** connection between devices for high-speed, secure file transfers, ensuring data privacy by never storing files on a central server.

##  Notable Projects

### [Statistical Analysis of Object Detection Models in Landmine Detection](https://github.com/VardhanVelamakanni/Landmine_detection_yolov12v8-FRCNN-SSD-Retinanet)
- **Technologies:** YOLOv8n, YOLOv12n, SSD300, Faster R-CNN (FRCNN), Computer Vision, PyTorch
- **Description:** A comparative research project focused on identifying the most efficient model for landmine detection. I trained and evaluated multiple architectures—including **YOLOv8n, YOLOv12n, SSD300, and FRCNN**—analyzing their precision, recall, and mAP scores to determine the optimal balance between speed and accuracy for humanitarian demining efforts.

### [Brain.Pulse (Brain Tumor Prediction)](https://github.com/VardhanVelamakanni/Brain.Pulse)
- **Technologies:** CNN, EfficientNetB0, Genetic Algorithm, CLAHE Image Enhancement, React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript
- **Description:** A deep learning-based system for detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI scans. The project integrates multiple convolutional layers, genetic algorithms for optimization, and a statistical approach to CLAHE image enhancement. It is fully implemented as a responsive web application.


### [DiskTrack (Disk Scheduling Algorithm Simulator)](https://github.com/VardhanVelamakanni/DiskTrackSim)
- **Technologies:** JavaScript, Chart.js, Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Description:** A web-based simulator that visually demonstrates various disk scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, etc.) using interactive graphs to help users understand seek time and performance.
